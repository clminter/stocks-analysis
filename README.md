# **Stock Analysis: VBA Code Performance**
## Project Overview
#### Project focuses on developing the coding skills necessary to create:

2. visual, numeric and conditional cell formating for more appealing and emphatic output.
3. a refactoring of the original code to measure performance between the two versions.
