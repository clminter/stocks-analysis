# **Stock Analysis: VBA Code Performance**
## **Project Overview**
### Purpose
#### For selected stocks over a two year period, the original code analyzed total volume of trading and return of each stock for each year. This initial project was then expanded to include the possibility to analyze ALL stocks over this period. This required refactoring of the code and testing the time elapsed between the original code and the refactored code to determine that the refactoring indeed created a more efficient model.
### Challenges
#### Developing the coding skills necessary to create: 
1. 'for loops', 'if-then' statements, 'indices', 'logical operators' and 'arrays' in order to analyze stock market data.
2. visual, numeric and conditional cell formating for more appealing and emphatic output.
3. a refactoring of the original code to measure performance between the two versions.
## __Results__
### Stock Analysis 2017 & 2018

#### This analysis for 2017 shows that the selected stocks, with exception of one, had positive returns.

#### Conversely, this analysis of the selected stocks in 2018 shows negative returns for all but two of the stocks.

### Coding Development
### For loop and array example:

#### Elements of the array are indexed sequentially from 0 to 11 which begins the iterative process of running through the for loop to meet the conditions.

### Conditional Formatting example:

#### In this example, conditional formatting for coloring cells that meet certain criteria is processed through an array and for loop.
